/// A specialized [TextFormField] widget that integrates with
/// an [OnscreenKeyboard].
///
/// This widget behaves like a regular Flutter [TextFormField], but
/// includes additional features to automatically attach and
/// interact with an onscreen keyboard widget.
///
/// ### Additional Features:
/// - Automatically opens the [OnscreenKeyboard] when this field gains focus,
///   and closes it when it loses focus (if [enableOnscreenKeyboard] is true).
/// - Registers itself with the [OnscreenKeyboardController] so key presses
///   are directly applied to this input.
/// - Provides optional [TextEditingController] and [FocusNode] management
///   if none are supplied.
/// - Visually highlights the field when it is the active
///   onscreen keyboard target.
///
/// ### Usage
/// ```dart
/// const OnscreenKeyboardTextFormField(
///   decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Enter Name'),
/// );
/// ```
///
/// ### Onscreen Keyboard Specific Options
///
/// - [enableOnscreenKeyboard]: If set to false, this widget
///   will function as a regular [TextFormField].
/// - [onscreenKeyboardMode]: Initial keyboard mode.
